## Presentation requirements.

You need to prepare a 3-5 minute presentation about your algorithm. Prepare 3-5 slides about your algorithm in PDF format. Once your presentation is done, either issue a pull request to add it to this directory of the repo, or send it to me by email. The final time to submit it is Wedn Nov 4 at 11:59pm. 

Your presenation has to address:

1. Group number and your place; whether your algorithm sorted correctly at the competition.
2. How the data was represented in your program (Strings, arrays, your custom types, etc).
3. What algorithms were used for sorting? Be clear about what they were applied to. If they were modified from the classical (CLRS) implementation in any way (or if they are not listed in CLRS), describe the changes or the algorithm.
4. State the running time is in terms of Big-theta of the worst case. If you are making a claim that your time on the given data is in a different Big-theta class than the worst case, please explain why. Also, estimate constants by the number of times the array gets traversed.
5. List all of the non-constant memory used in addition to the given array and what it is used for.
6. Address any correctness concerns that you get from the group that checked correctness of your algorithm. If you agree with their analysis then simply say so.
7. If you would like, mention what you would have changed to make the program run faster.

Keep in mind that lists and tables work better for slides than long sentences.

Please take notes when listening to the presentation; you will need those for the final write-up.

## Final write-up requirements.

The final write-up is individual work. 

The final write-up has two parts: the description of your algorithm (if you presented on another group's algorithm then of their algorithm), and a summary of what algorithms overall turned out to be the most effective for this problem and why.

Each of the two parts should be about a page long.

The algorithm description should follow the guidelines for the presentation, only be more detailed. Examples (of data storage, etc.) help.

The algorithm comparison should list all approaches that were used for the problem by all teams (e.g. "three groups used variations of radix sort") and their comparative effectiveness. Note that data represntation plays a significant part in efficiency. 

Please summarize what have you learned through the competition.

The final write-up needs to be submitted to me by the end of the day Friday Nov 13 as a google or a pdf file, by email.
